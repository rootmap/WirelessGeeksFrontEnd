Program Description:

Allows you to quickly and easily install apps that you have downloaded to your computer in the form of ".apk" files onto your Android phone or device via USB connection.

Important Note:

The program also requires that the Visual Basic 6 runtime library be installed on your computer in order for it to function. Most computers already have this installed. To be sure that you do, check in your windows\system32 folder for the file "Msvbvm60.dll". If it's there you're good to go. If not, the package can be downloaded for free from our download page at:
